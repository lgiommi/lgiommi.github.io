            Thesis entitled: Prototype of Machine Learning “as a Service” for
            CMS Physics in Signal vs Background discrimination<br>

            Abstract:<br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;"> This thesis aims at contributing
              to the construction of a Machine Learning “as a service” solution
              for CMS Physics needs, namely an end-to-end data-service to serve
              Machine Learning trained model to the CMS software framework. To
              this ambitious goal, this thesis work contributes firstly with a
              proof of concept of a first prototype of such infrastructure, and
              secondly with a specific physics use-case: the Signal versus
              Background discrimination in the study of CMS all-hadronic top
              quark decays, done with scalable Machine Learning techniques.</div>

            Thesis entitled: Predicting CMS datasets popularity with Machine
            Learning<br>
            Supervisor: Prof. Daniele Bonacorsi<br>
            Co-Supervisor: Doct. Valentin Kuznetsov<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Abstract:<br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;"> This thesis presents the design,
              development and exploitation of a supervised Machine Learning
              classification system aimed at attacking the very concrete need of
              the prediction of the popularity of the CMS datasets on the Grid.
              The CMS experiment has completed its first data taking period at
              the LHC (Run-1). After a long shutdown (LS1), CMS is now
              collecting data on p-p collisions at 13 TeV of centre-of-mass
              energy in Run-2. The amount of experience collected in CMS
              computing operations during the last few years is enormous, and
              the volume of metadata in CMS database systems which describes
              such experience in operating all the CMS workflows on all the
              Worldwide LHC Computing Grid Tiers is huge as well. Data mining
              efforts into all this information have rarely been done, but are
              of crucial importance for a better understanding of how CMS did
              successful operations, and to reach an adequate and adaptive
              modelling of the CMS operations, in order to allow detailed
              optimizations and eventually systems behaviour predictions. A Data
              Analytics project has been launched in CMS and, within this area
              of work, a specific activity on exploiting machine learning
              techniques to predict dataset popularity has been launched as a
              pilot project. The popularity of a dataset is an important
              observable to predict, as its control would allow a more
              intelligent data placement, large optimizations in the storage
              utilization at all Tiers levels, and would form the basis of a
              solid, self-tuning, adaptive dynamic data management system. This
              thesis describes the work done exploiting a new pilot prototype
              called DCAFPilot, entirely written in python, to attack this kind
              of challenge.</div>
